## About the project
Built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vue cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/). The project utilises [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) vue as a CSS framework but relies on postcss for certain css features which are not yet available in Tailwind (mainly pseudo classes and styling triangles :small_red_triangle_down:).

[i18n library](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/) is included for an easy integration of multiple languages. Translations are currently included for English and Icelandic (a great opportunity for you to learn some Icelandic words if you don't know any! :slightly_smiling_face:
